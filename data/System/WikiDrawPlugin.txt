---++ Usage

!WikiDrawPlugin uses [[http://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/][SVG-edit]] (trunk svn from 29/09/2010 - pre2.6) to provide quick and easy drawing or annotation of images. 

__WARNING: editing is not possible with Internet Explorer - but viewing of the drawings works correctly__

---+++ Syntax Rules
%INCLUDE{%SYSTEMWEB%.VarWIKIDRAW}%
---++++ save drawing as attachment to current topic
%JQREQUIRE{"chili"}%<verbatim class="tml">
   %WIKIDRAW{
      "drawing"
      annotate="http://somewhere.onthenet.com/some_image.png"
   }%
</verbatim>

---++++ save drawing to a 'WikiDrawForm' topic
!WikiDraw also can save the svg source for the drawing as the text of a topic - allowing searching and hand editing of that source, while continuing to provide the wysiwyg editing facility.
<verbatim class="tml">
   %WIKIDRAW{
      "Sandbox.WikiDrawing"
      annotate="Sandbox.SomeImage/some_image.png"
   }%
</verbatim>

---+++ Extra Plugin support.
If Foswiki:Extensions.ImagePlugin is installed and enabled, the default skin template will automatically use it to lay out the image and drawing.
   
---++ Technical details
This plugin adds a ext-foswiki.js extension that over-rides the built in 'Save Image' SVG menu item with a save to foswiki handler, 
which generates a png version of the overlay, and sends that, and the svg source to foswiki.

The transparent overlay png is displayed in view mode, and the annotated image (if any) will be put behind it using the css background.

---++ Known issues:
   1 it really doesn't like using svg dimensions other than 640x480 (I'e reported an [[http://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/issues/detail?id=727][issue]] for this, as its really painful when creating a drawing)
   6 hide the edit buttons for ie..
   1 _DEFAULT="Web.Topic/something" is very broken
   6 =strikeone= support
   7 comment support..
   8 wow. subtle bug. - using =%!WIKIDRAW{Sandbox.SomeTopic}%=, _will_ find the first image attached to BASETOPIC, which might be a tad surprising.
---+++ features to be added?
   5 can we diff the svg's ?
